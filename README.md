Link to the web-app: https://the-booth-ten.vercel.app/

> GDG BorderHack Hackathon Project · May 2026

Upload a short sports video clip → get an instant **FAIR CALL** or **BAD CALL** verdict with rule-based reasoning grounded in official rulebooks. **Inconclusive** may also be returned if the model cannot confidently determine whether the call is legal or illegal.

**Supported sports:** Basketball · Soccer · Baseball · Football · Hockey

## How It Works

Two-pass Gemini pipeline:
1. **Sport Detection** — Gemini auto-detects the sport from the video
2. **Rule Injection** — The relevant official rulebook is injected as system context
3. **Analysis** — Full call analysis with specific rule citations returned as structured JSON
